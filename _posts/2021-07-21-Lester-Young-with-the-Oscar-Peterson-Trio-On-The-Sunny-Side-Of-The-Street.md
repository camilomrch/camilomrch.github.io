A most successful standard, "On the Sunny Side of the Street" has been interpreted by a host of musicians since the Great Depression, including music giants like Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, and Louis Armstrong.
In this version, Lester "The President" Young takes center stage, using his tenor saxophone to wrap up the track in a fresh summer garment of progressions, while the Oscar Peterson Trio plays away among some refined yet unassuming guitar licks by Barney Kessel.
