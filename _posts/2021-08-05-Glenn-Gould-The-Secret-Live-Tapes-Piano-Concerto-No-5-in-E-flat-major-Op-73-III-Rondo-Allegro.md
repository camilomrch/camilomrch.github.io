The closing movement of the cycle of the "Emperor Concerto", Beethoven's last piano concerto, in the majestic performance by Glenn Gould under the direction of Josef Krips and accompanied by the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra in Buffalo, NY on November 6, 1960.

An energetic conversation between horns and oboes interweaves with the fabric of Gould's piano scales in the digressions of the rondo, lending the movement the characteristic familiarity of allegro refrains stirred with Gould's glowing take on Beethoven's tempos.
